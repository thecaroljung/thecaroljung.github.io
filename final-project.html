Clients were asked what they do, what their career goals are, how they will measure their success, any obstacles they forsee, and what features and expectations they have for personal portfolio website.

It is also good to see what I can do to make my service unique and different from the rest.

        <p class="blue-text text-center">The way I prioritized my features is by giving each feature a user value, business value, and implementation effort value which ranges from 1 being high/hard and 5 being low/hard. In this way, I am considering how costly and timely a certain feature is and also how important it is to the user and to the business. I can incorporate this information by prioritizing the implementation of features with lower values.

This gives me insight into how users are thinking and see if I can make any changes to wording, for instance, so that users will better understand how to navigate in my site. The other test was the question test. This was to get users to actually write about their thought process and opinions. For instance from the information I get from asking where they would go on my site to view works, I can see if users are having a hard or easy time finding it. This will tell me if I should be making changes or not to my site to give a better experience.

        <h3 class="blue-text text-center about-h3-font-size">Summary of Findings</h3>
        <br>
        <p class="blue-text text-center">From user interviews, I found that for personal portfolio websites, people look for unique styling and design that makes the site stand out. People expect a lot of pictures in the photo gallery and mobile friendly design that are easy to navigate. Other needs were contact information and introductions of the staff and services. When I was researching competitors, I found that though some of the competitors had very nice design and animations, it became extraneous and frustrating when trying to find information quickly. It was interesting conducting the user tests because I was able to see if the users were able to understand the flow of my site. Users were able to carry out the tasks quickly on my site. </p>
        <br>
        <p class="blue-text text-center">I got more out of the user interviews and competitor analysis compared to the user tests because my site was simple so the tasks were relatively easy to carry out and everyone completed it well. Even with user tests, I gained the most valuable information through the question test by asking users to explain their thoughts on layout and design. User interviews gave me more information about how I should tailor my site to give users what they expect and want from a portfolio site which was to have mobile friendly design and more photos. </p>

        <br>
        <p class="blue-text text-center">From asking users questions about what they like about the site and what they expect from a personal portfolio site, I found that users want a lot of pictures and mobile friendly design. For my site directly, users have said that the solid blue color could be changed to something else and that the font could use some work. So moving forward, I would try to use a sans serif font because for my site, I think serif is a bit too serious. I think changing the solid blue color to either something more transparent or some other design will help my site look more lively. </p>
        <br>
        <p class="blue-text text-center">Challenges will be in trying to find the right font that has the right feel and right characteristics. It is always tough trying to find the right font, so that will be a time consuming task, but when the right font is there, it will look great! </p>
